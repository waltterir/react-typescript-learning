# React + TypeScript Learning Repo

⚠️ Work in progress — updated continuously while learning React + TypeScript.

This repository contains my React + TypeScript practice components and examples. I use this repo to explore different typing patterns, component structures, and state handling techniques.

This repository serves as a TypeScript + React pattern reference for my future projects.

## Topics covered

- Typed props
- Union types
- Event typing
- useState typing
- Children props
- Component patterns

Created as part of my TypeScript learning journey.
